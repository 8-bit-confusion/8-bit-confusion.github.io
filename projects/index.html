                Created using the Dart programming language and Flutter app developement framework,
                Booklist is an app I built to keep track of the books I've read, my progress in the
                books I'm currently reading, and the list of books I want to read. Implemented
                features include:
            </span>
            <ul style="margin-top: 0px;">
                <li>searching for books and sourcing data via the Google Books API,</li>
                <li>JSON serialization, local saves, and imports/exports for all app data and
                    configurations,</li>
                <li>customizable visual themes,</li>
                <li>a barcode scanner to automatically find physical books by their ISBN,</li>
                <li>and a stats page to track pages read and books completed by various time
                    periods, the data for which is automatically saved when reading progress
                    is updated.</li>
            </ul>
            <span>
                Booklist can be sideloaded on Android from
                <a href="https://prettytoastie.itch.io/booklist" target="_blank">itch.io</a>,
                and an unsigned iOS app package and Windows desktop application are also
                available for download though these platforms are not recommended.

                            window management, events, and writing pixels. Most algorithms
                            are based on the work done by Sebastian Lague in

                        on a generative AI research project who were newer to Python. It
