                    <h2>Howdy hey! I'm Lily Wasko :3</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of Virginia
                        currently studying Computer Science and Environmental Thought & Practice.
                        Outside of the programming projects I've worked on, I like to spend my
                        free time playing indie games (and devloping my own), writing short stories,
                        reading novels, taking care of my plants, making tea, and hanging out with
                        my collection of stuffed animals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm currently reading <i>Last Night at the Telegraph Club</i> by Malinda Lo,
                        which I've been thoroughly enjoying, with <i>Alchemy and a Cup of Tea</i> by
                        Rebecca Thorne and <i>The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet</i> by Becky
                        Chambers up next on my list. My favorite books of all time are <i>We Are Okay</i>
                        by Nina LaCour and <i>Private Rites</i> by Julia Armfield.
                    </p>

                        My (small) collection of plants inlcudes a Variegated Snake Plant (<i>Dracaena
                        trifasciata 'Laurentii'</i>), the bottom half of which is pictured alongside one
                        of my plushies; a Baltic Blue Pothos (<i>Epipremnum pinnatum 'Baltic Blue'</i>);
                        and a <i>Monstera deliciosa</i>.
